# StringCalculator

Simple calculator that adds by using delimiters.

Add function works on 1-3 digit numbers, custom delimiters, ignore newlines, and throws exceptions for negative numbers.
old_add function works on 1 digit numbers, simple delimiters, ignore newlines, and throws exceptions for negative numbers.

Add was created after old_add was implemented in an insufficient design.
Testing is also implemented.
